							<h2>Voice Over Jobs From Home – 7 Companies To Work For</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Are you looking for voice over jobs? You can actually do this from home. There is not always a need to go to an actual studio. Lots of people make extra money doing voice overs from home!</p>
						<p>Today's post breaks down how it works, what you could earn, who is cut out for it, and of course where to go to find work.</p>

						<p> </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>What Are Voice Over Jobs?</h3>
						<p>Voice work, or “voice acting” as it's sometimes referred to, is pretty self-explanatory. Most of the time, it's when you hear someone's voice narrating a commercial, audio book, movie or television program, video game, or even a live event.</p>
						<p>In a nutshell, you're paid to lend your voice to a project in need of a voice.</p>
						<p> While this is often done outside the home, it's not that hard to find voice over work that you can do from home. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>What Do Voice Over Jobs Pay?</h3>
						<p> According to Payscale.com, the average range for voice over talent is about $39.87 hourly. That said, what you earn will vary wildly depending on the company you're doing the work for, you're experience, and other factors. </p>
						<p> It goes without saying, but you'd obviously earn a great deal more for lending your voice to a commercial or TV project than you may for selling voice talent on a site like Fiverr. </p>
						<p> There is definitely potential in the voice over industry to make part-time or even full-time income. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>Who Is Cut Out For Voice Over Work?</h3>
						<p> If you have a pleasant speaking voice, that's a start! But beyond that, you need to realize freelance work of any kind can be a constant hustle, especially in the beginning. You'll have to be up for that. </p>
						<p> There is a certain amount of patience, consistency with applying for work and finding clients, and a “not-giving-up” attitude you'll need to have to see real long-term success here. </p>
						<p> If you've ever tried to strike out on your own as a freelancer in any field, then you already know that you a steady supply of clients/jobs is important to ensure you can continue paying the bills. Voice over work won't be any different in that regard. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>What Equipment Do Voice Over Artists Need?</h3>
						<p> If you're doing voice over work from home, you'll need to invest money in some equipment. You won't necessarily need studio-level equipment just starting out, but it's better to have something </p>
						<p> At the bare minimum, you should have: </p>
						<p> - Microphone </p>
						<p> - Mic stand (if your microphone doesn't come with one) </p>
						<p> - Headphones </p>
						<p> - Software </p>
						<p> Gravy for the Brain has a more extensive list here that you may want to read over. But the items listed above may be enough for you to get going. Later on, after you've earned some income, you may be able to invest in better equipment. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>Voice Over Jobs From Home</h3>
						<p> The websites listed below often have listings for voice over jobs from home. So if you want to get started, </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>1. Filmless</h3>
						<p> Filmless hires freelance voice over artists worldwide. Job description says having your own studio is ideal, but not required. Note the job listing does say they prefer 5+ years of past voice work experience. Pay information isn't listed, and I wasn't able to find an estimate online. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>2. Fiverr</h3>
						<p> Fiverr – People are often searching Fiverr for voice over services. You can sign up as a Fiverr seller and list your voice over services, and possibly get paid for your work. </p>
						<p> Fiverr is open to people worldwide. While the base amount you can list your services for on Fiverr is $5, you can always list various add-ons that make many of your gigs pay much more than that. </p>
						<p> Because there are no prerequisites to getting signed up, Fiverr is probably one of the best ways to get started as a complete beginner. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>3. Snap Recordings</h3>
						<p> Snap Recordings – Snap Recordings occasionally hires people to work from home doing voice overs. They specialize in telephone greetings. </p>
						<p> Snap Recordings is open to voice over talent worldwide. You must provide a demo reel before they will consider you. Unfortunately, they don't have pay info listed nor could I find that info online. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>4. Upworks</h3>
						<p> Upwork is a freelance bidding site where there are frequently voice over gigs listed. </p>
						<p> Note that bidding on a job you find on Upwork is not a guarantee of getting accepted. You'll need to take some time to flesh out your portfolio on the site and update your profile to help ensure it is attractive to potential clients. </p>
						<p> Also, please be careful of scams on Upwork. There are some fake employers on there who will pretend to hire you. </p>
						<p> Most of the time, these fake employers want to conduct the interview via Skype or Google Hangouts. They'll “hire” you quickly, and then ask you to deposit a check from them for “office supplies.” </p>
						<p> The instructions will be to keep part of the money and wire the rest back to them. It's a fake check, and you'll be held responsible by your own bank for trying to deposit a fraudulent check. More info on this scam here. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>5. Voices.com</h3>
						<p> Voices.com is one the largest communities of talent, actors, producers, and narrators online. As a member of this community, you'll have access to new voice over job postings daily. </p>

						<hr />
						<h3>6. Voice123</h3>
						<p> Voice123 is another marketplace, similar to Voices.com (above) for finding voice work. And like Voices.com, they also have various membership options, including a free option. </p>
						<p> This site doesn't take commission or agent fees. You are paid directly by the client. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>7. Voice Bunny</h3>

						<hr />

						<hr />
						<h3>Free Voice-Over Mini-Course</h3>

						<p> - You've thought about audiobook narration as a way to earn money. </p>
						<p> - You are interested in voice over work in general. </p>
