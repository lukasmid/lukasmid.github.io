							<h2>DROPSHIPPING</h2>
						</header>
						<p>A traditional ecommerce store requires you to hire employees, store products, maintain inventories, and more. It’s apparent just how expensive and tedious the entire process could be.</p>
						<p>But with dropshipping, you can sell your desired product(s) online, minus the hassle that comes with offering traditional order fulfillment services.</p>
						<p>There’s no need to hire a team, and you don’t need any investment in shipping technology either.</p>
						<hr />
						<h3>Here’s how a typical dropshipping business model works:</h3>
						<p> - You create a website and upload pictures of your products with their prices. </p>
						<p>	- The customer buys the product and pays you online. You keep a margin for yourself and forward the order to the manufacturer, or dropshipping supplier you’ve partnered with. </p>
						<p>	- The manufacturer delivers the product to the customer to complete the order.</p>

						<hr />
						<p> As is discernible from the above infographic, dropshipping requires you to act like a mediator between the consumer and the supplier. </p>
						<p> Dropshipping is very easy to start, sustain, and yield significant profits. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3> There are multiple benefits of dropshipping, including: </h3>
						<p> - There is no substantial investment at the start (no need to rent or hire) </p>
 						<p> - You don’t need to pay for a warehouse (since the manufacturer stores the product) </p>
						<p> - You don’t have to deliver the product, and hence you don’t incur transport expenses </p>
 						<p> - Direct contact with customers help you build your brand image </p>
 						<p> - There are plenty of dropshipping success stories out there to look for inspiration. </p>
 						<p> Let’s take an example of <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/">Wayfair.</a> </p>
 						<img src="images/wayfair.jpg">
 						<p> Wayfair grew at a rate of 25% to 35% year-over-year. In fact, they once racked up revenue of $4 million in a single day. </p>
 						<p> Without any doubt, <a href="https://www.salehoo.com/">suppliers like Salehoo> are one of the essential parts </a> of your dropshipping business. </p>
 						<hr />
 						<p> You can use top platforms like <a href="https://www.spocket.co/?gspk=UGFydG5lclRsbXNp&gsxid=5YbXUc6xVwb9&utm_campaign=PartnerTlmsi&utm_medium=content&utm_source=affiliate">Spocket</a> to connect with the suppliers that align best with your business goals. </p>
